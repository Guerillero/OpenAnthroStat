# OpenAnthroStat
A free Freelist analysis program in the early stages of development written in python 2.X. The goal is to create a fully 
functional platform for the analysis of freelists and pile sorts under a free licence. Currently, it can only anylize freelist 
data and has a very simple GUI written with `Tkinter`.

##Use
As long as everything in this package is in the same directory, general users shouldn't need to do anything more than running `OpenAnthroStat.py`. 

##Salience
OpenAnthroStat calculates Smith's S and Sutrop's S (Smith & Borgatti 1998; Sutrop 2001). Since they are not always the 
same, an average is taken and is displayed as `Aggregate S`. 

###Functions
Stand alone functions to calculate both Smith's S and Sutrop's S can be found in `salience.py`.
