# OpenAnthroStat
A free Freelist analysis program in the early stages of development written in python 2.X. The goal is to create a fully 
functional platform for the analysis of freelists and pile sorts under a free licence. Currently, it has no GUI and can 
only output csv files.

##Use
The `config.py` file contains two strings. `importFile` is the path to the file containing the raw data and `outputFile` 
is the path to place where the csv file will be outputted.

##Salience
OpenAnthroStat calculates Smith's S and Sutrop's S (Smith & Borgatti 1998; Sutrop 2001). Since they are not always the 
same, an average is taken and is displayed as `Aggregate S`. 
###Functions
Stand alone functions to calculate both Smith's S and Sutrop's S can be found in `salience.py`.
